## Programmers

This project is a [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site. If you've used a static site generator before, you're pretty much good to go. If not, take a look through the [Eleventy documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) to get up to speed.

### Getting Started

It's a JavaScript site, so you'll need `node` installed. Using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) will make sure you're using the right version.

```sh
# git clone, etc
yarn        # install dependencies
yarn serve  # run development server
```

Then open [localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123/) in your browser, and you should be ready to disco.
